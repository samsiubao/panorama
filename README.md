# panorama

This was an assignment for my Computer Vision class. Basically, we had to be able to take in images and stitch them together into a panorama. We were not allowed to used a lot functions from cv2 and scipy since the point of the assignment is for us to write these from scratch. 

Assignment specs are in CV_HW4.pdf file.
Best way to run this is by opening hw4.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. Run all the kernels, and outputs are saved to output folder. The code does take awhile to run.

The folder part 6 contains some images I found from another panorama stitching code example that I used this code to stitch into a panorama.  Unfortunately, I can't find the site where I found these photos from to give credit, but if anyone does know, please let me know.
